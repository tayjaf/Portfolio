# Crypto Ricers

Crypto Ricers is a virtual game where users can build, own, and collect Ricer cars, and monetize their gaming experiences on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Background

This project was built as part of a team project for the NFTHack hackathon sponsored by ETHGlobal.


## Usage

Users design their cars through a React front end.  They connect to the blockchain via MetaMask and submit their car to be minted into an NFT.  The image of the car along with its metadata is stored on IPFS.  The user's account address and the image data are used to mint the new NFT in an ERC721 smart contract.
