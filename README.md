# Overview:
**2014 - PHYS104-6 Design Lab:** MATLAB-written simulation of an object using gravitational assist off of Jupiter.

**2015 - PHYS LAB:** MATLAB-written solar system simulation model using second-order differentials to solve the two-body problem off each planet and the SUN. 3D simulation was created using built-in functions and custom functions in order to incorporate the 2014 Lab involving the gravitational assist of an object (still using Jupiter's influence).

**2020 - Discord Message Bot:** written in JS, a bot is introduced to a Discord server where commands can be issued by any user to invoke a response (i.e. pull up socials, analytics from CoinGecko, and so on).

**2020 - Discord Price Tracker Bot:** written in JS, a bot posts in a Discord server when a transaction is made on a Uniswap V2 or Sushi pool regarding specific tokens specified.

**2021 - NFTHackathon Project (Crypto Ricers)** - project worked on by a team of 5 with little background knowledge in Solidity. Wrote smart contracts in order to mint an NFT of a car when all parameters are chosen on the front-end; as well as assisted with designing and developing the front-end.

**2022 - SORA (Python Swap Bot)** - created a simple swap bot using Python and using SubstrateInterface (rust) in order for a user to automatically make swaps between tokens for MarketMaker rewards on the SORA network. 


**2022 - SORA (Bridge Alert Bot & Governance Bot)** - created a bot  written in Python and using SubstrateInterface (rust) that would indicate in a Telegram channel or group when a suspicious transaction takes place on the SORA HASHI bridge (deployment of contracts and transactions touching Tornado Cash), and when a governance vote is initiated or voted upon.
