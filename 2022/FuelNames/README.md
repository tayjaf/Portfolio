# FuelNames

Fuel Names available on the Fuel Protocol!

Fuel names allows users to mint a ".fuel" address, similar to how ENS functions on Ethereum.

The goal is to simplify the act of sending transactions on Fuel, while also allowing people to rep their love for Fuel on Twitter!

Upon connecting your wallet, you will be able to search for the domain of your choice. Mint it and rep it!

How it's Made
This project is built entirely with smart contracts written in Sway with the front-end being developed with Fuel's typescript SDK. Fuel's architecture allows users to mint at extremely low costs.

We think this will be the first NFT traded on the Fuel Network at scale, and we can't wait for participants of the network to mint their name!
